<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The is a code and data repository associated with the research of Team 6 in ECS260. The topic of our research is <em>An Empirical Study of Tests in Open-source Projects of TravisCI on GitHub </em>.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Data Restoration
We download and restore MySQL dump files from GHTorrent into a MySQL database on a virtual machine running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Currently, we have restored a snapshot of GitHub metadata in August, 2015, and another one in June, 2019. Due to the limit of time, we have only finished processing the snapshot captured in August. 2015.

We generate 'gh-active-projects-legacy.csv' file based on the snapshot of GitHub metadata captured in 2015 by running the following SQL:
```SQL
select u.login, p.name, p.language, count(*)
from projects p, users u, watchers w
where
    p.forked_from is null and
    p.deleted is false and
    w.repo_id = p.id and
    u.id = p.owner_id
group by p.id
having count(*) > 50
order by count(*) desc
```

### Data filtering
We found that TravisPoker,  the tool included in TravisTorrent project (https://github.com/TestRoots/travistorrent-tools) for checking if a repository use Travis CI, is unusable possibly due to lack of maintenance. Therefore we studied TravisTorrent source code and developed our own Node.js program that queries Travis API to check the usage of Travis CI in all of the repositories indicated by the rows in .csv file. 

To use this program, the developer should have Node.js installed on the machine and run the following command in the project directory:
```console
npm install
node index.js
```
This will produce 'gh-active-projects-legacy-o.csv' file, which an integer at the end of each row indicating the 'last_build_number'. If the number is -1, then it means the repo does not use Travis CI.

### Preliminary Data Analysis
We developed Python program to do preliminary data analysis based on 'gh-active-projects-legacy-o.csv' file to find differences in the use of Travis CI in different language projects, and visualize the results.
